# Resumption — linked T0 candidate, hardware gate still open

Owner: synapse-lie fork; DS4 remains the other agent's project.
Repository: `/home/paperboy/workspace/projects/synapse-linux/synapse-lie` on `.155`.
Branch: `feature/initial-runtime`, from `develop` seed `ce3ce59`.
This increment starts at `79625ce`. No workflow or independent review is claimed.

## Latest target admission — 2026-09-30 18:53 UTC

Following the operator's explicit go-ahead after the idle-node inspection,
`tools/smoke-model.py` and the unchanged `t0-linked-r4` binary were staged under
private LIE run directories on `.157`. Two attempts at 18:49 and 18:51 refused
admission on a busy DS4 download lock, exit 1, **before any LIE model open**.
No target model/DSO smoke or inference was performed. At 18:53 a DS4 `native-perf`
warm-up was using the GPU at 98%, with download/qualification/shared locks held.
Do not enter between its benchmark phases. No background retry is scheduled.

See [T0-SMOKE.md](T0-SMOKE.md) for the exact operator-window scope, predeclared
requests, observations and preserved `t0-model-smoke-r1/r2` receipts. Staging a
private test binary is not a service installation or a working-model result.

## Policy and actual status

The user permits embedded Gufo for T0, followed by requirement-driven T1/T2
refactoring toward an autonomous C backend. The older reference-only prohibition
is superseded, not the autonomy goal. See BACKEND.md and INFERENCE-REACTIVE.md.

**An actual HIP-linked executable now exists. No LIE GPU/model execution has
occurred.** The code path is no longer merely an adapter object: C HTTP/SSE,
worker, bounded queues, flow control and provider binding are connected. A
separate synthetic executor tests that path without pretending to run a model.
The original-weight first-working-build acceptance gate is therefore still open.

## Implemented in this increment

- `src/worker.c`: one pthread device owner, eight bounded admissions, one active
  sequence by default or two explicitly configured interleaved single-row
  sequences. Round-based chunk/step scheduling; never native batching by claim.
- Independent worker and consumer references keep jobs alive after disconnect.
  Short metadata gates protect publication and cancellation-latch versus
  sequence detachment. No GPU wait is held under these gates or on the HTTP loop.
- Eight token slots per job, 256 bytes each. Decode reserves/begins before work;
  SSE releases/replenishes credits only after uv_write completion. Nonstream
  reserves a bounded aggregate sink. Active admission is not a measured RAM fit.
- Text request validation and copied ownership; pinned Qwen renderer, thinking
  disabled, context admission before session creation/forward, greedy AR only.
  Streaming UTF-8 replacement decoding is independent of token boundaries.
- Real nonstream JSON and SSE formatting, usage/finish/error terminals, queue
  refusal, disconnect, request deadline and shutdown lifetime handling.
- ABI 2 adds chat preparation and provider metadata/selection. Gufo types remain
  inside the adapter. The neutral worker opens the selected composition binding;
  `lie_gufo_open` remains explicitly Gufo, not renamed into an ownership claim.
- For loaded-runtime backend failure, adapter drains device work before returning
  failure/allowing retirement. Undrainable device failure exits 70 without retry
  or core dump. This exceptional hardware path is compile/link checked, not GPU
  fault-tested. Successful calls have no added device-wide barrier.
- Diagnostics disclose engine, source pin, build label, delegated/synthetic/none
  ownership and unsupported capabilities. `--build-info` opens no model.
  Hardware qualification is false. Worker counters are not remote-delivery ACKs.
- Opt-in `LIE_GUFO_RUNTIME`; real libraries from independently fetched upstream.
  A LIE-owned Qwen-only CMake scope uses the upstream model target and unchanged
  source. It is not the full upstream release build. No numerical port exists.

No tools, native batching, MTP, vision, prefix reuse, RAM/SSD restore or CUDA is
exposed. Unknown memory/latency/throughput/cache metrics remain null. Default
no-model startup still has readiness 503, empty models and chat 503. The synthetic
provider is only in test executables and reports `NOT-INFERENCE`.

## Preserved build/verification evidence

All paths below are local `evidence/` directories; labels are occupied. Receipts
record actual process exit codes, logs and source/binary identities.

| Label | Observed result / scope |
|---|---|
| `gufo-host-r1` | Full upstream configure failed, exit 1: missing rocWMMA header. No install or fake header. |
| `gufo-qwen-host-r1` | Qwen subset archives built, no execution. |
| `t0-runtime-r1` | Eight CPU/synthetic suites passed with GCC, Clang, ASan/UBSan; Gufo header object passed. Before final cancellation/error refinements. |
| `t0-linked-r1` | Link failed, exit 1: omitted upstream sample/argmax translation unit and curl link dependency. Failure preserved. |
| `gufo-qwen-host-r2` | New private subset build includes real upstream sampling unit and curl dependency; original source unchanged. |
| `t0-linked-r2` | Real HIP adapter linked; eight CPU/synthetic suites and no-model smoke passed. No weight/model/GPU execution. Before final refinements. |

`t0-runtime-r2` passed all eight suites in GCC/Clang/ASan/UBSan at
18:11:53–18:12:10 UTC, including the final binding/error/lifetime refinements.
`t0-linked-r3` passed real linking, `--build-info`, no-model and synthetic tests at
18:12:19–18:12:26 UTC, with no model access/GPU execution. Its binary SHA256 is
`b7b42150d070bf91915d2859ce66b71fed2d386f4a7f12682d5e1736309fd1d6`.

Following this evidence/coordination documentation update, final closure labels
are **`t0-runtime-r3`** and **`t0-linked-r4`**. Their `result.json` and the delivery
receipt, not this planned
label or a build target, establish success and exact source identity. Fresh
label-owned build directories preserve earlier artifacts. Local link verification
masks GPU visibility, isolates HOME/cache/temp, records ELF dependencies and
never supplies `--model` to the real server.

Eight suites: `chat-parser-wire`, `worker-synthetic`, `reactive-flow`, `metrics`,
`monitor-parser`, `executor-c-layout`, `http-monitor`, `http-synthetic`.
The synthetic suites exercise in-flight cancellation with a barrier, owner-thread
checks, context refusal, queue saturation, a stalled peer, real TCP backpressure,
UTF-8 split/invalid bytes, JSON/SSE equivalence, deadline, poison, error terminal,
FD cleanup and shutdown. They are not GPU/numerical/quality evidence. ASan/UBSan
covers first-party CPU paths and the fixture, not the unexecuted GPU kernels.
No TSan, independent review or promtool pass is claimed.

Earlier `cpu-closure-r1/r2`, `reactive-closure-r1`, `backend-scope-r1`,
`backend-evolution-r1`, guard refusals and their delivery receipts remain historical
and unchanged. The old policy/guard result is not reinterpreted retrospectively.

## Coordination: last live check

At **2026-09-30T18:13:29Z**, SSH `.155 -> .157` succeeded and
`/tmp/synapse-lie-ds4-coordination/ds4-ack.json` was absent. Evidence:
`t0-coordination-readonly-r3.json`. Earlier checks at 16:25 and 17:23 also lacked ACK.
No remote build, model hash/conversion, model run or new remote service was started.
No DS4 file, cache, service, profile, model or qualified artifact was changed.

Idle hardware or acquiring our own new lock would not be consensus. The DS4
owner must acknowledge adoption/runner/lock ordering, then a shared lease and
execution register must cover a fresh preflight and each admitted run. See
COORDINATION.md. Access to SSH alone is not that authorization.

## Next authorized work after the hardware gate

1. Fresh identity/memory/storage preflight; stat the original five read-only files
   against inventory, without assuming old values are live or rehashing weights.
2. Private serial target build and independently pinned pristine comparator;
   record compiler, flags, source, binary and runtime dependency identities.
   Local workspace visibility on `.157` must not be assumed.
3. Original-weight C1 short-context AR: validate physical prompt IDs, completed
   frontiers and output against the reference, then nonstream/SSE equivalence,
   UTF-8, cancellation, backpressure and quiescent retirement. Define settings
   and oracle before execution. No rollout.
4. Only with a correct baseline, collect separate pure-inference traces and test
   a falsifiable internal-reactive change. Completed PP/TG, concurrency and serving
   improvements remain separate; no benefit has been measured yet.
5. T1/T2 refactoring, native C2/4/8, tool continuity, complete RAM/SSD state and
   MTP remain separate gates; CUDA follows qualified AMD work.

Do not reintroduce the historical assistant-imposed 32 GiB reserve as a user
requirement, call the DS4 300K stop an OOM, or import DS4's benchmarks/quality into
LIE. The monitor/UI is still development en_US; v0.1 is not release-ready.
